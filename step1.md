# Introduction
The purpose of this example is to show how to deploy a static website in an asset canister. While the website in this example is very simple, the method would be the same for a more advanced static website, e.g. based on popular static site generators.

This example covers:

- Build a very simple HTML website
- Create the dfx.json file
- Deploy the canister smart contract locally
- Test the frontend in browser
